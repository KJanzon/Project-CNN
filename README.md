# Image Classification with CNN

Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images from a given dataset into predefined categories/classes.

[Task Descriptions and Project Instructions](https://github.com/ironhack-labs/project-1-deep-learning-image-classification-with-cnn)


## Project Results
In this project, we classified images from the animals 10 data set.
- Pre-processed data 
- Built a sequential CNN model 
- Optimized the model
- Prediction accuracy of: 80,99%


## Repository Folders and Files

Here is a short description of the folder and files available on the repository.


### Documents
- Presentation
- holdout_subset.zip. You can use these images to predict with the model

### Notebooks  
- split_validation_set: split the data set to one set for training and testing (90%) and a second one to make predictions (10%)
- model_1.ypynb : The starting point model
- model_optimized_ypnb: The optimized model
- transfer_learning_winner.ipynb: using VGG16 to predict the data set
