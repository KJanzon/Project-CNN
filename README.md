# Image Classification with CNN

Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images from a given dataset into predefined categories/classes.

[Task Descriptions and Project Instructions](https://github.com/ironhack-labs/project-1-deep-learning-image-classification-with-cnn)


## Project Results
In this project, we classified images from the animals 10 data set.
- Pre-processed data 
- Built a sequential CNN model 
- Optimized the model
- Prediction accuracy of: XX%
